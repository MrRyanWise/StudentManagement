Welcome to my student management project that would help schools easily and automatically manage their students.

This application manage student enroolments and balance and have many functionalities like:

<ul>
    <ol>Ask the user how many new students will be added to the databas</ol>
    <ol>The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student</ol>
    <ol>A student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level</ol>
    <ol>A student can enroll in the following courses :</ol>
        <ul>
            <li>History 101</li>
            <li>Mathematics 101</li>
            <li>English 101</li>
            <li>Chemistry 101</li>
            <li>Computer Science 101</li>
        </ul>
    <ol>Each course costs $600 to enroll</ol>
    <ol>The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition</ol>
    <ol>To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance</ol>
</ul>
